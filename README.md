# Analysis-of-Algorithms
Some of my Goucher College CS330 (Analysis of Algorithms) course projects
These are three implementations of a sudoku solver that use the following three approaches to solving the sudoku puzzle:
A brute force algorithm, SAT (Satisfiability) reduction algorithm and a backtracking algorithm that uses  a greedy heuristic.
All three approaches have varying run times for each puzzle test case, and these speak to on the efficiency of each algorithm, and therefore which one would
be most favorable (i.e. runs fastest).
